headings.css
=============

An experiment in replicating the nested header styling of modern browsers.
potentially allowing us to normalise html5 styles in ie7 and ie8.

Based on a combination of very hard work by Christopher Boone and Johnathan Neal 
and analysis of the individual useragent stylesheets.
